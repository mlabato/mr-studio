# Landing page for "MR Estudio"

## Introduction
This is a landing page created for a web services company specialized in web development, community managament and UX design.

## Overview and functionalities
The project was thought as a responsive Single Page Application (SPA), so React.js was the perfect framework for achieving this. For the styling
I used Tailwind.CSS for the styling which helped with the responsiveness ((414px, 768px and 1024px)) and for the "contact" form I preferred to use Firebase instead of creating an API in an Express developed back-end.

## Framework
- React

## Extra libraries
- Tailwind CSS
- React-icons

## Run this sample!
